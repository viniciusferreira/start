Start
=====

A simple PHP application skeleton with a "start" (or pico framework).

The ability to work as a **PHAR** compiled, class autoload compatible with **Composer** and a template engine using **zTags©** and/or **Blade©**, make this an excellent base for the development of virtually **any** PHP application.
